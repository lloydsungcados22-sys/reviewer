pandas>=2.0.0
numpy>=1.24.0
streamlit>=1.28.0
Pillow>=10.0.0
openai>=1.12.0

# Document processing (CRITICAL - must install)
pdfplumber>=0.10.0
PyMuPDF>=1.23.0
python-docx>=1.0.0
reportlab>=4.0.0

# OCR support

# EasyOCR and PyTorch (CPU versions - smaller size)
# These are large packages (~1.5GB total). Installation may take 5-10 minutes.
# If installation fails on Streamlit Cloud Community tier, these packages may be too large.
# Alternative: Remove torch/torchvision/easyocr and use Tesseract OCR only (see requirements-no-ocr.txt)


# Note: EasyOCR downloads language models (~500MB) on first use, which may take 2-5 minutes
# Tesseract OCR (optional fallback) requires system-level installation:
# - Windows: Download from https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki
# - Linux: sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr  
# - macOS: brew install tesseract

# STREAMLIT CLOUD DEPLOYMENT NOTES:
# 1. Ensure this file is in the ROOT directory of your GitHub repository
# 2. In Streamlit Cloud: Main file path = "app.py"
# 3. If packages fail to install, check deployment logs in Streamlit Cloud dashboard
# 4. If torch/torchvision installation fails due to size/timeout:
#    - Try removing those 3 lines (torch, torchvision, easyocr)
#    - Use requirements-no-ocr.txt instead (OCR will be disabled but app will work)
# 5. First deployment may take 10-15 minutes due to large package downloads
