## Unified requirements for both local development and Streamlit Cloud
## This file MUST live at the repository root used by Streamlit Cloud.
## It includes all libraries needed by:
## - The PH Criminology Reviewer app (PDF/Word/OCR processing)
## - The sample timesheet app in this workspace

# Core
streamlit>=1.28.0
pandas>=2.0.0
numpy>=1.24.0

# UI / plotting
openpyxl>=3.1.0
plotly>=5.0.0
Pillow>=10.0.0

# LLM / API
openai>=1.12.0

# Document processing (critical for reviewer app)
pdfplumber>=0.10.0
PyMuPDF>=1.23.0
python-docx>=1.0.0
reportlab>=4.0.0

# OCR (Tesseract-based, light enough for Cloud)
pytesseract>=0.3.10
opencv-python-headless>=4.8.0

# Database
snowflake-connector-python>=3.0.0

# NOTE ABOUT EASYOCR / TORCH
# EasyOCR + PyTorch are intentionally NOT included here because they are
# very large and often fail to install on Streamlit Cloud Community tier.
# The app will still work using Tesseract OCR only. If you want EasyOCR
# on a more powerful tier, add these manually in your own fork:
#   torch>=2.0.0,<2.2.0
#   torchvision>=0.15.0,<0.17.0
#   easyocr>=1.7.0
